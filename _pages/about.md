I am a tenure-track associate professor in the [John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/) (affiliated under the School of Computer Science), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 
At SJTU, I am also a member of [Emerging Parallel Computing Center (EPCC)](http://epcc.sjtu.edu.cn/).
Prior to joining SJTU, I worked as a Researcher at Huawei Hong Kong Research Center (2012 Labs) from Aug. 2018 to Dec. 2021. 
I obtained my PhD degree in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Bo Li](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~bli/) and [Prof. Wei Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/index.html). 
During my PhD studies, I also had a fantastic visiting experience at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Baochun Li](https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/bli/).
I obtained my Bachelor degree in 2014 from the [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua Univerity](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

My research aims at optimizing distributed systems supporting modern applications, with a special focus on machine learning applications in topics of Federated Learning, Deep Learning Scheduling and LLM Inference. 
I am particularly interested in identifying fundamental system challenges in these areas and investigating system solutions that are efficient and easy to use. I am always looking for self-motivated undergraduate, Master and PhD students. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested.
